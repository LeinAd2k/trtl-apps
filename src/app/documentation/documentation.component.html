        Once you have created a new app in the console you are ready to get started. In the overview section
        of the console you can find your <span class="code-block">app ID</span> and <span class="code-block">app secret</span>.
        Using these keys you able to make API calls to the TRTL apps service. See the <a href="/getstarted">getting started guides</a> for more
        information on how to interact with the API from your environment.

      <p>
        In the app dashboard section of the console you can use the API using a GUI interface. This is a good way to
        experiment with the functionality available in TRTL apps as well viewing app activity.

      <p>
        Webhooks are a way for your app to receive notifications of backend events as they happen, like when a user makes a new
        deposit for example. To receive these notifications
        you can set a webhook URL for your app in the console.
