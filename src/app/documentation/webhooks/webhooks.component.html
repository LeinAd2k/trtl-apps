      <p>
        Webhooks are a way for your app to receive notifications of backend events as they happen. To receive these notifications
        you can set a webhook URL for your app in the console. When a new event occurs, a <span class="code-block">POST</span> request
        is sent to the webhook URL. Each event type has a unique code, and a data property containing the event details.
      </p>
      <p>
        The backend expects a 2xx response code to indicate that the notification was received. In the event of failure,
        the backend will retry the sending the event a few times in larger time intervals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below the different event types are listed along with example data.
      </p>
      <!-- <div class="section-spacer"></div>
      <mat-card-title>User updated</mat-card-title>
      <p>
        This event fires every time a user object has been updated, for example when their balance changed.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>{{ userUpdated | json }}</pre>
      </div> -->
      <div class="section-spacer"></div>
      <mat-card-title>New deposit</mat-card-title>
      <p>
        This event is sent when a new user deposit is detected. New deposits start with a <span class="code-block">confirming</span>
        status while we wait for block confirmations.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>{{ depositConfirming | json }}</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="section-spacer"></div>
      <mat-card-title>Deposit succeeded</mat-card-title>
      <p>
        Once the deposit has been confirmed, the user's balance is credited with the deposit amount and the deposit succeeded
        event is sent.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>{{ depositSucceeded | json }}</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="section-spacer"></div>
      <mat-card-title>Deposit cancelled</mat-card-title>
      <p>
        In the case where the deposit transaction was not confirmed in the blockchain, the deposit is marked as failed
        and the deposit cancelled event will be fired.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>{{ depositCancelled | json }}</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="section-spacer"></div>
      <mat-card-title>Withdrawal succeeded</mat-card-title>
      <p>
        This event is sent when a user withdrawal has been successfully processed.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>{{ withdrawalSucceeded | json }}</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="section-spacer"></div>
      <mat-card-title>Withdrawal failed</mat-card-title>
      <p>
        In the case where a user withdrawal was not processed succesfully, the user's balance will be reimbursement
        with the amount and the withdrawal failed event is sent.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>{{ withdrawalFailed | json }}</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="section-spacer"></div>
    </mat-card-content>
